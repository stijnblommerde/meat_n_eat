**Description**<br />
Meet N’ Eat is a social application for meeting people based on their food interests<br />

**Features**
* Meet N’ Eat leverages the Google Maps API and Foursquare API in order to find a restaurant for users and geocode 
locations into latitude and longitude coordinates.
* Users are able to log in with either a username/password combination or using an OAuth provider 
like Google or Facebook. The application generates it’s own tokens for users.
* All endpoints use rate limiting to prevent abuse of your API.
* Documentation for the API is created in a way that is developer friendly and
aesthetically pleasing.
